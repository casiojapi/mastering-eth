## about PoS

The major difference between PoS and PoW is that the punishment in PoS is intrinsic to the blockchain (e.g., loss of staked ether), whereas in PoW the punishment is extrinsic (e.g., loss of funds spent on electricity).

## principles of consensus

The principles and assumptions of consensus algorithms can be more clearly understood by asking a few key questions:

+ Who can change the past, and how? (This is also known as immutability.)

+ Who can change the future, and how? (This is also known as finality.)

+ What is the cost to make such changes?

+ How decentralized is the power to make such changes?

+ Who will know if something has changed, and how will they know?

Consensus algorithms are evolving rapidly, attempting to answer these questions in increasingly innovative ways.
