# dapps
 
 ## what is a dapp?

   + backend software (app logic)
   + frontend software
   + data storage
   + message communications
   + name resolution

why would I need a dapp and not a capp (?)

Resiliency
Because the business logic is controlled by a smart contract, a DApp backend will be fully distributed and managed on a blockchain platform. Unlike an application deployed on a centralized server, a DApp will have no downtime and will continue to be available as long as the platform is still operating.

Transparency
The on-chain nature of a DApp allows everyone to inspect the code and be more sure about its function. Any interaction with the DApp will be stored forever in the blockchain.

Censorship resistance
As long as a user has access to an Ethereum node (running one if necessary), the user will always be able to interact with a DApp without interference from any centralized control. No service provider, or even the owner of the smart contract, can alter the code once it is deployed on the network.

and some examples but not that useful tbh
